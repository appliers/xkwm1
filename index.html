Hey guys! I'm writing this right now because I have just planned a release of Izen v2! The planned release date of Izen v2 is around early December.<br>
But you may be asking yourselves, why?<br>
Why am I releasing Izen v2 when I can add so much more?<br>
Why am I releasing Izen v2 when there is little updates?<br>
Those are all good questions, which is why I'll answer them right here!<br>
<br>
I'm releasing Izen v2 because we are drastically changing the code for Izen v2. For Izen v1, we just used Index.js to put our code in. But for Izen v2, we have coded a proper
command handler. We'll be taking advantage of readdirSync, path, and module.exports { } in v2.<br>
Another question you may ask is: "Where is the v1 code going?"<br>
Well, the v1 code is going in v2 too! So we won't get rid of any of those fun games. We will also make v1 source code public.<br>
We will still update v1 after v2 is released, but it will receiving updates on January 9th, 2021.<br>
We will also finish the Izen website. I just don't like coding in HTML5 and CSS3.
